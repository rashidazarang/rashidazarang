### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ â€“ Iâ€™m Rashid  
> Professionally, Iâ€™m best described as an Architect of Intelligence.  

My work spans across:  
- Systems Design  
- Data Modeling  
- Cognitive Architecture  
- Diagnostics & Frameworks  

I focus on building coherence where things are fragmented, formalizing structure where thereâ€™s noise, and turning workflows into usable, evolving intelligence.
