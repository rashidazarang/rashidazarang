### Hi there 👋 – I’m Rashid  
> Architect of Intelligence  

My journey has led me to explore:  
- Systems Design  
- Data Modeling  
- Cognitive Architecture  
- Agentic Workflows & Diagnostics  

🌱 Currently learning and building around recursive intelligence, epistemic engineering, and making intelligence usable for both humans and AI  

🤝 Open to collaborating with those curious about the **architecture beneath intelligence**—from AI builders and system designers to philosophers and operators
