### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ â€“ Iâ€™m Rashid
Professionally, Iâ€™m best described as an Architect of Intelligence.

My work spans across
	â€¢	Systems Design
	â€¢	Data Modeling
	â€¢	Cognitive Architecture
	â€¢	Diagnostics & Frameworks

I thrive on building coherence where things are fragmented, formalizing structure where thereâ€™s noise, and turning workflows into usable, evolving intelligence.

> ðŸŒ± Learning continuously about recursive intelligence, epistemic engineering, and how to make intelligence usable for humans and AI alike

> ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with folks curious about the architecture beneath intelligence: from AI builders and system designers to philosophers and operators
