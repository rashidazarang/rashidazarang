### Hey it's **Rashid** 👋  
> Professionally, I’m best described as an Architect of Intelligence.

I work at the foundations of usable intelligence where systems, people, and AI meet.

**Focus areas** 
- Systems Design  
- Data Modeling  
- Cognitive Infrastructure
- Agentic Workflows & Diagnostics  

🌱 **Currently exploring:** recursive intelligence, epistemic engineering, and how to make intelligence usable for both humans and AI

🤝 **Open to collaborating with:** AI builders, system designers, philosophers, and operators curious about the architecture beneath intelligence
